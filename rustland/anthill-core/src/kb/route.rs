//! Goal-routing registry for queryable persistence backends.
//!
//! Proposal 007 §11 + 026.1 Q4 (Stage B). When the resolver encounters a
//! goal whose head functor is registered here, it consults the
//! [`RouteHandler`] before (in addition to) the discrim-tree lookup. The
//! handler returns an [`ExternalStream`] whose `Value::Entity` rows enter
//! σ via `bind_value` — no `TermStore` allocation per row.
//!
//! ## Scope (Stage B v1)
//!
//! - Registry keyed by **head functor symbol**. One handler per functor.
//!   Multiple sorts routing to the same store register the same handler
//!   under each functor.
//! - Lookup is direct (`HashMap<Symbol, …>`); the anthill-level
//!   `route(GoalSort(?))` rule is *not* yet consulted at resolution time.
//!   Wiring the route-rule path is downstream — see proposal 007 §11
//!   "Q4 implementation contract (landed)".
//! - Eager drain at `step_init`: every row matching the goal is converted
//!   to a candidate `Substitution` before the choice point is built. Lazy
//!   per-iteration pumping is a follow-up; the eager path is correct, just
//!   memory-proportional to the matching row count.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! Handlers live for the lifetime of the [`KnowledgeBase`]. They are
//! registered once (typically at startup, after stdlib load) and consulted
//! on every routed goal. A handler must produce a fresh stream per
//! `retrieve` call — concurrent / nested resolutions each get an
//! independent cursor.
