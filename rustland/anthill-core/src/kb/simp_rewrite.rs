//! WI-277 — typer-phase `[simp]` rewriting engine.
//!
//! The second firing site for `[simp]` equational rules (proposal 043 /
//! `docs/design/simp-rewrite-design.md`). As a separate pass over operation
//! bodies (before `type_check_sorts`/`req_insertion`), it fires matching
//! `[simp]` equations LHS→RHS bottom-up over the `NodeOccurrence` tree and
//! writes the rewritten, redex-free tree back via `set_op_body_node`. This
//! is the resolver's `apply_eq_rules` (`resolve.rs`) counterpart for the
//! occurrence representation — "one rewriter, two phases."
//!
//! Reuse: matching is the existing discrimination tree via `match_view`
//! (`Rc<NodeOccurrence>` is a `TermView`, WI-276/277); DeBruijn opening is
//! the KB's `term_from_debruijn`. The only occurrence-specific piece is the
//! build side, [`substitute_to_occurrence`], which constructs the RHS as a
//! `NodeOccurrence` (carrying span + `Synthesized` provenance) on top of the
//! shared `walk_view`.
//!
//! Firing (WI-283) matches an `is_equation` + `[simp]` rule's LHS via
//! `match_view`, then applies the type-directed guard
//! ([`super::typing::simp_fire_guard_holds`]): a rule scoped to a
//! parametric sort (its functor is a *spec op*, e.g. `Numeric.add`) fires
//! only where its carrier arguments' `min_sort` provides that sort; a
//! concrete functor (`add(?x, 0) = ?x` at top level) is guard-free. Loaded
//! equations are headed by the canonical `anthill.prelude.PartialEq.eq`
//! ([`KnowledgeBase::eq_functor`]), the symbol the firing index keys on.
//! Explicit value-level guards (`:- compare(?x, ?y) <= 0`) give the rule a
//! non-empty body, so it is not `is_equation` and not yet indexed for
//! firing — proposal 043 §4.1 / a follow-up.
//!
//! Recursion depth (WI-278): the walk is iterative. [`rewrite`] descends the
//! tree on an explicit `Visit`/`Build` work-stack, and
//! [`substitute_to_occurrence`] builds the RHS on a second work-stack — both
//! mirroring the sibling `NodeOccurrence::Drop`, `materialize_from_handle`,
//! and the typing pass, which were made iterative to survive deeply-nested
//! bodies (the 624-line typing_pass_spec.anthill). This was a prerequisite for
//! shipping `[simp]`/dot rules that fire on real (possibly deeply-nested)
//! operation bodies: the engine can no longer overflow the host stack on
//! source nesting depth.
//!
//! One driver, both carriers (WI-641 Phase 2 + WI-643): [`rewrite`] is
//! carrier-neutral — it descends a [`Value`] that is EITHER a `Value::Node`
//! occurrence (the typer phase; and the resolver's `anthill prove` Node goals)
//! OR a hash-consed term (the resolver's `apply_eq_rules`). The two carriers
//! share the one iterative loop; they differ only in [`children_of`] (descent)
//! and [`reassemble_value`] (reassembly), and in the firing STRATEGY behind the
//! [`SimpFirer`] trait. This retired the resolver's separate recursive term
//! walk, so a deeply-nested term redex no longer overflows the host stack nor
//! stops at a fuel-as-depth cutoff.
